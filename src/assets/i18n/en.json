        "naslov": "1. The publication of all documentation regarding the reconstruction of the railway station in Novi Sad, which is currently unavailable to the public",
        "sadrzaj": "The students demanded the publication of the complete documentation related to the reconstruction of the Railway Station in Novi Sad. The initial response to this demand was that only the Prosecutor’s Office had access to the documentation, but shortly thereafter, it was partially published by other state authorities. Our colleagues from technical faculties, as well as from the Association of Architects of Serbia, have noticed that the published documents are missing key documentation necessary to establish the criminal responsibility of those who managed the reconstruction of the Railway Station and were involved in it.<br></br><br></br>\nSpecifically, the missing documents include contracts that show who did what on the Railway Station and how much it cost, why the reconstruction cost increased fivefold, as well as who is responsible for the Railway Station being ceremonially opened twice without an occupancy permit.<br></br><br></br>\nOn 12 December, the Government of the Republic of Serbia ordered the Ministry of Construction, Transport, and Infrastructure (MCTI) to publish all documents “at their disposal” and “related to the possible commission of a criminal offense due to the collapse of the canopy on the station building in Novi Sad.” This formulation leaves room for the Ministry to withhold certain documents if it deems them unavailable or not related to the canopy collapse. As a result, 195 documents were published, compared to the 857 held by the Prosecutor’s Office.<br></br><br></br>\nBy thoroughly reviewing the published documents, we identified deficiencies, of which the key ones are as follows:<br></br>\n\n  <li>CONTRACTS WITH CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS</li>\n  <li>INTERIM AND FINAL SITUATIONS, BILLS AND INVOICES</li>\n  <li>TENDER DOCUMENTATION FOR CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS</li>\n\n<b><i>Document 03, dated 9 October 2017:</i></b><br></br>\n<br></br>\nProject assignment for the development of the conceptual design with a Justification Study for the modernization, reconstruction, and construction of the BG-SU-State Border Railway.<br></br>\n<b>MISSING:</b><br></br>\n\n  <li>The technology of work execution and Proposal for the technology, organization, and dynamics of work execution in accordance with the characteristics of the designed facilities (as required by the project assignment).</li>\n\n<b><i>Document 04, dated 13 December 2017</i></b><br></br>\n<br></br>\nDecision on the Establishment of the Joint Commission for QUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE, AND FINANCIAL DOCUMENTATION CONTROL subject to the Contract for the Development of the Conceptual Design with the Justification Study for the section of the NS-SU-State Border Railway.<br></br>\n<b>MISSING:</b><br></br>\n\n  <li>Contract for the Development of the Conceptual Design with the Justification Study for the section of the NS-SU-State Border (Kelebija) Railway, No 340-01-00493/2017-04, dated 20 October 2017, between the Republic of Serbia, the Institute of Transportation CIP, and the Serbian Railways Infrastructure JSC.</li>\n  <li>Preliminary Contract for the development of the Feasibility Study for the modernization of the BG-SU-State Border (Kelebija) Railway, dated 14 April 2015, No 340-01-00073/2015-01, between the Republic of Serbia and the Institute of Transportation CIP.</li>\n\n<b><i>Document 10, dated 6 August 2020</i></b><br></br>\n<br></br>\nREPORT on the professional review of the Justification Study and the Conceptual Design (CD)<br></br>\n<b>MISSING:</b><br></br>\n\n  <li>Location conditions dated 6 April 2020.</li>\n\n<b><i>Document 54, dated 12 September 2022</i></b><br></br>\n<br></br>\nReport of professional supervision on the review of the Construction Design 2/9.1.1.1 – static calculation – Version 3 of the Detailed Design (DD).\n<b><i><br></br>Document 56, dated 12 September 2022</i></b><br></br>\n<br></br>\nReport of professional supervision on the review of the Construction Design 2/9.1.1.1. – reinforcement and steel details – Version 3 of the Detailed Design (DD).<br></br>\n<b>MISSING:</b><br></br>\n\n  <li>Versions 1, 2, and 3 of the Detailed Design for the Construction Design.</li>\n\n<b><i>Document 57, dated 12 October 2023</i></b><br></br>\n<br></br>\nReport of professional supervision on the review of the Architectural Design – Detailed Design (DD) – Version 4<br></br>\n<b>MISSING:</b><br></br>\n\n  <li>Versions 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Detailed Design for the Construction Design.</li>\n\n<b><i>Document 36, dated 28 February 2024</i></b><br></br>\n<br></br>\nDraft Decision of the engineer regarding additional works based on the instructions from the Financier/Client, to be the subject of Annex 4.<br></br>\n<b>MISSING:</b><br></br>\n\n  <li>Annex to the Draft Decision of the engineer.</li>\n  <li>Engineer’s decisions regarding additional works or offers for additional works to be the subject of Annex 1.</li>\n  <li>Annex 1</li>\n  <li>Offer for additional works to be the subject of Annex 2</li>\n  <li>Annex 2</li>\n  <li>Offer for additional works to be the subject of Annex 3</li>\n  <li>Annex 3</li>\n\n<b><i>Document 38, dated 8 March 2024</i></b><br></br>\n<br></br>\nReview of the Proposal for the Decision on the Acceptance and Signing of Annex 4 to the Commercial Contract dated 7 July 2018.<br></br>\n<b>MISSING:</b><br></br>\n\n  <li>Engineer’s Decision dated 25 October 2022, engineer’s Decision dated 3 October 2022, engineer’s Decision dated 8 March 2024.</li>\n  <li>Draft of Annex 4 with a price table.</li>\n<br></br>\nIN ACCORDANCE WITH:<br></br>\n\n  <li>The Rulebook on the Content and Method of Conducting Professional Supervision (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, Nos 22/2015 and 24/2017).</li>\n  <li>The Special Building Usance (Official Gazette of the SFRY, No 18/77).</li>\n<br></br>\n<b>MISSING:</b><br></br>\n\n  <li>Construction Logbook</li>\n  <li>Construction Record Book</li>\n  <li>Inspection Book</li>\n  <li>Minutes of Handover of the Worksite to the Contractor</li>\n  <li>Minutes of Work Handover and Final Settlement Report</li>\n  <li>Certificates of Installed Materials</li>\n<br></br>\n<i><u>We emphasize that the purpose of this demand is not only to make the documentation available to the public but also to encourage the Prosecutor’s Office to review it within the scope of its functioning system and subsequently take actions provided for by law.</u></i>"

We demand confirmation from the competent authorities regarding the identity of all individuals reasonably suspected of physically assaulting students and professors, as well as the initiation of criminal proceedings against them.

The criminal complaint concerns individuals reasonably suspected of physically assaulting students and professors of the Faculty on 22 November 2024, committing the criminal offense of Violent Behavior and Violent Behavior at a Public Gathering or Sporting Event¹.

        "naslov": "4. Increase in the higher education budget by 20%",
        "sadrzaj": "The allocations for higher education provided for by the Budget Law of the Republic of Serbia for 2025 from the sources of General Budget Revenues and Income amount to <b>60.15 billion dinars.</b> The allocations for higher education include items from the budget for <i>Higher and University Education</i> (Chapter 26.4), <i>Student Standard</i> (Chapter 26.5), and <i>Criminal Police University</i> (Chapter 15.1). The students have every right to demand an increase of 20% in the aforementioned funds (i.e., an increase of approximately 12.03 billion dinars, or 102.8 million euros), which would bring the level of investment in higher education closer to that of Central and Eastern European countries (<u>1.71% of GDP</u>, according to OECD methodology).<br></br><b>Why was the demand not fulfilled?</b><br></br>A 20% increase in “material costs” was announced, which would lead to an overall budget increase of only 4% (i.e., 22 million euros). <u>“Material costs,” therefore, refer only to a segment of the budget for <i>Higher and University Education</i>.</u><br></br>Instead of the requested improvement in the quality of higher education, part of the public has been misled into believing that the demand has been met.<br></br><b>Justification of the demand</b><br></br>The availability, accessibility, and quality of higher education are the standards of a progressive society, and its financing must not be questioned. The state is obliged to provide conditions in which higher education is a choice available to everyone, with a quality that is competitive on global university rankings. Shifting the financial burden from students to budgetary income would significantly ease the conditions of studying at all levels, enabling greater participation of financially disadvantaged groups in higher education.<br></br>Therefore, we demand the introduction of a new funding mechanism that, following amendments and supplements to the Law on Higher Education, would provide faculties with funds equivalent to <b>50% of the total value of ECTS points</b> that students would otherwise pay. <u>This would increase the funding for higher education without changing the actual cost of ECTS points</u> (set by the faculties), <b>and students would pay 50% lower tuition fees than the full amount.</b> We consider this the first step toward free education. Furthermore, we demand that the remaining funds be evenly distributed between other budget categories, including <i>Student Standard</i> and <i>Higher and University Education</i>, excluding salaries and other employee income.<br></br>We also note that the limited capacity of faculties to engage in scientific research hinders society in terms of technological and economic potential, while insufficient funding for research leads to <u>the devaluation of the professional workforce and encourages their emigration from the country.</u><br></br>For all the reasons stated above, we demand that the <b>Government</b>, based on Article 123, paragraph 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and Article 150, paragraph 1 in conjunction with Article 171 of the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly, submit to the National Assembly a <b>Proposal for Amendments and Supplements to the Budget Law of the Republic of Serbia</b> for 2025, in order to increase the budget for higher education by <b>12.03 billion dinars</b>. Additionally, we demand the <b>amendments and supplements to the Law on Higher Education</b> that would oblige the state to contribute 50% of the total value of ECTS points. <u>We consider the demands to be met when the National Assembly finally adopts the submitted Proposal in its original form, with the requested amendments and supplements to the Law on Higher Education.</u> We remind you that in accordance with Article 106 of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, an extraordinary session can be convened, which would lead to the prompt unblocking of universities, provided that the first three demands have been met.<br></br><u>By fulfilling these demands,</u> the total allocation for higher education would amount to 110.55 billion dinars and the share of spending on higher education in Serbia would thus reach <b><u>1.11% of GDP,</u></b> which we consider the minimum acceptable level of investment in future budget laws.<br></br><br></br><u>What unites all of our demands is that we request the institutions of the system to do their job according to the law and in the interest of all citizens.</u> <br></br><b>The blockades will remain until the demands are fulfilled.</b>"

      "question1": "What is a plenum?",
      "answer1": "A plenum is an open forum at a faculty or university where students gather directly to discuss the strategies and tactics of protest actions. During a plenum, decisions about organizing protests are made through collective voting, ensuring transparency and the possibility for public critique.",
      
      "question2": "How can I help?",
      "answer2": "You can help in several ways: by making financial donations used to cover the costs of organizing protests (such as printing flyers, renting spaces, and securing protective equipment), by sharing information via social networks, and by attending protests in person. This helps spread the message and gather public support.",
      
      "question3": "Who can participate in the plenum?",
      "answer3": "All students can participate in the plenum, regardless of faculty or major. It is important that every voice is heard, and critical opinions are welcome, which contributes to a democratic and open discussion about future actions.",
      
      "question4": "How are donations used?",
      "answer4": "Donations are used transparently to finance protest costs such as logistics, the production of promotional materials, organizing performances, and supporting victims of violence. Funds are publicly reported at the plenum so that all participants can see how the money is spent.",
      
      "question5": "What are working groups?",
      "answer5": "Working groups are specialized teams of students that focus on specific aspects of the protest movement – such as logistics, communication, legal support, PR, and security. They enable more efficient task distribution and coordination of actions, with activities continuously coordinated through plenums.",
      
      "question6": "How can I join a working group?",
      "answer6": "You can join by attending one of the plenums or by contacting the organizers via social networks. This way, you can express your interest and receive instructions on how to join a particular working group – whether you are interested in protest organization, PR, or legal support.",
      
      "question7": "What are the main demands of the students?",
      "answer7": "The students demand a thorough and independent investigation of the accident in Novi Sad, the public release of complete documentation on the reconstruction of the canopy, accountability for those responsible, an increase in the budget for higher education, and a reform in the way authorities operate to prevent a similar tragedy in the future.",
      
      "question8": "How are protests organized?",
      "answer8": "Protests are organized in a decentralized manner – students gather at plenums where decisions are made collectively. Working groups then take on specific tasks (logistics, communication, legal support) to ensure that actions such as blocking key roads and organizing marches are carried out efficiently. This model has allowed the protest movement to quickly expand and gain broad support.",
      
      "question9": "Are the protests democratic and safe?",
      "answer9": "Although the protests take place under challenging conditions, the organizers strive to conduct them according to democratic principles. Decisions are made collectively, and special security working groups work to protect participants. Despite pressures, both students and citizens continue to gather to express their dissatisfaction and demands for change.",
      
      "question10": "How is freedom of speech and the right to protest protected?",
      "answer10": "Freedom of speech and the right to protest are fundamental rights that students actively defend. Open debate is encouraged at the plenums, and legal teams provide support in case of reprisals. With the support of citizens, students demand that the authorities respect constitutional and international standards, while the media and independent organizations work to shed light on events.",
      
      "question11": "Where can I find the latest information about the protests?",
      "answer11": "You can follow the latest information through the official websites of protest movements, the organizers’ social networks, student portals, and independent media outlets covering events in Serbia. It is also recommended to follow announcements from the plenums and working groups to stay updated on all news.",
      
      "question12": "What to expect in the coming days?",
      "answer12": "Organizers are announcing the continuation of protests, including massive blockades of key roads, additional tribal marches, and public gatherings. Students urge citizens to join as the movement aims to bring about long-term reforms and completely eradicate corruption. The protest movement will continue until the demands are met and the authorities show a willingness to implement real changes."
